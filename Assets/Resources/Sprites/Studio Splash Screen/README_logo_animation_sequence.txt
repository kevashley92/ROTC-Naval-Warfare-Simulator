** The letter p falls forward from the logo and makes a crashing sound
- It leaves a white hole in the splash screen background

- If (and only if) the user clicks on the hanging letter p, the rotation sequence will begin
- If the user does not click the letter "p" after within a short amount of time, next screen will load
- Else, the airlock handle graphic will begin rotate
- As the handle begins to slowly spin, the color red begins to move down through the studio title (the intention is to simulate water draining from the bottom of a ship or submarine, leaving behind a red background)
